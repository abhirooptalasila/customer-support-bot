# Customer Support Bot

Assignment Title: Automated Response Generation for Customer Support
Objective: Build a model to generate automated responses to customer queries.
Dataset: [Customer Support Responses](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kaludi/Customer-Support-Responses)

Tasks:
* Explore and preprocess the dataset.
* Train a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model or use a transformer-based model like GPT-3 for generating responses.
* Fine-tune the model for coherence and relevance.
* Evaluate the generated responses for quality and appropriateness.

Deliverables:
* Code and documentation
* Response generation model
* A demo where users can input a query and receive an automated response (implemented in a Jupyter notebook)


Repo Details:
* `training.ipynb`: Contains the model fine-tuning code. All steps are explained in detail.
* `demo.ipynb`: Contains the code for generating responses based on input queries.
* `test_responses.csv`: Contains the test set queries and responses generated by the model before and after fine-tuning.
